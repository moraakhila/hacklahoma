### Inspiration

Star Wars trivia can draw inspiration from various sources, including the movies, books and comics, video games, and fan culture. You can create questions based on the plot, characters, and behind-the-scenes details of the Star Wars universe. Additionally, you can incorporate lesser-known characters and events from books and comics, as well as characters and locations from video games. Fan theories, trivia, and discussions are also excellent sources of inspiration for Star Wars trivia questions.

### What it does

Starwar_trivia is a game or activity that revolves around asking and answering questions about the Star Wars franchise. It is typically enjoyed as a fun game with friends, family, or fellow Star Wars fans, and involves recalling memorable phrases and quotes from the franchise's characters.

### How we built it

With HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, it is possible to create a website that allows users to play Star Wars trivia and learn about different characters from the franchise. HTML provides the structure and content of the webpage, CSS is used to style the webpage and make it look visually appealing, and JavaScript is used to add interactive elements such as buttons, forms, and pop-up windows.

### Challenges we ran into

Initially, we thought of uploading an user image and converting it to an avatar which significantly matches starwars characters and due to time constraint for the predicting face resemblance it didnt become possible. Our team came up with the idea of incorporating character voices into the quiz questions by implementing a voice-over feature in the backend, so that when a user selects a character, the corresponding character's voice will read out the quiz questions. Also, we faced difficulties to implement animations to our application, however with team we are able to overcome it.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

Applying animation throughout the application. Made backend authentication working.

### What we learned

Upon realizing that we were struggling to meet the tight deadlines, we recognized the importance of improving our skills to ensure that we can work more efficiently and effectively. We learned about how to use animations to website. We also learned how to use multiple webpages to create a website. We got to know that can develop valuable, technical and soft skills, such as coding, design, communication, and teamwork.
